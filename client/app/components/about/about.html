      <p class="about-text col-md-4">Tea Time Atelier, an inconspicuous jewel box tucked away into a quiet corner of Greenpoint,
        Brooklyn, has turned six years of sourcing and blending the finest teas and botanicals into a devoted and
        articulate history of tea connoisseurship. Behind the hidden storefront, single-estate teas are sold exclusively
        whole leaf, organic tea and herbal blends are still assembled by hand, and more recently, a collection of
        expertly-crafted, perfumed candles inspired by the companyâ€™s teas can be found against a backdrop of faded,
        aubergine walls. A serendipitous find for the earnest wanderer, this is a space that yields itself to the luxury
        of fine tea and an unwavering adherence to excellence.</p>
